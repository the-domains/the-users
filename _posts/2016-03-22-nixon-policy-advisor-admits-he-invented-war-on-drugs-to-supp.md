description: "Dan Baum, writing in support of drug legalization at Harper's, has unleashed a frank 1994 quote from former Nixon policy advisor John Ehrlichman, and as inadvertently salient an argument for legalizing drugs as any I've ever seen: At the time, I was writing a book about the politics of drug prohibition."
