description: "Tuberculosis has brought tragedy to Soe Lwin's* family. In 1998, his eldest brother, Aung, was admitted to hospital having contracted the respiratory disease. They lived just outside Yangon, among vast paddy fields. The hospital was grim. Aung ran away from the doctors and returned to his village where he later died from the disease."
