description: "Four heroin-addicted inmates in British Columbia jails have launched a charter challenge to gain opiate addiction treatment, arguing they deserve the same health care they could access in the community. The group contends that B.C. Corrections' policies unconstitutionally block them from being prescribed methadone or suboxone if they don't meet specific criteria."
