description: "The Senate last month confirmed Dr. Robert Califf to run one of the world's most influential health agencies, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The 89-4 vote followed a delay by a handful of lawmakers who had turned President Obama's nomination into a proxy fight over the FDA's willingness to approve opioid pain-killers, despite a growing problem with addiction nationwide."
