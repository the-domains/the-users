description: 'Mr. Myrick said his father battled crack cocaine addiction, which helped inspire him to create the committee to confront the heroin problem. Though unheard-of in the United States, supervised injection sites have existed in Europe for years - one of the first was in Switzerland, 30 years ago - and in Vancouver, British Columbia, the only city in North America where the practice is allowed.'
