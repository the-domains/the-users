description: 'Poppers will not be outlawed under the blanket ban of legal highs due to come into effect in Britain next month, Home Office ministers have confirmed. The last-minute reprieve for the liquid chemical drug - technically known as alkyl nitrites - which has been in use as a recreational drug since the 70s follows an outcry among the gay community who use poppers to prepare for sex and enhance sexual pleasure.'
