description: 'Humanity is pumping climate-warming carbon dioxide into the atmosphere 10 times faster than at any point in the past 66m years, according to new research. The revelation shows the world has entered "uncharted territory" and that the consequences for life on land and in the oceans may be more severe than at any time since the extinction of the dinosaurs.'
