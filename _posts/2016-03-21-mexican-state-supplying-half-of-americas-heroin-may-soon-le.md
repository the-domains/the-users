description: "Mexico City: The governor of one of Mexico's most violent states is making waves by proposing that impoverished farmers be allowed to grow opium poppies for legal medical use. Guerrero state is among Mexico's poorest, and many remote mountain communities already grow small plots of poppies, which are bought by drug cartels that have fought violent turf battles throughout the Pacific coast state."
