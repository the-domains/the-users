description: 'I spent a great day on Wednesday at the annual Alcohol Research UK conference. There was a huge amount of evidence on show, and discussion about the nature of evidence-based policy, how research can produce impact and shape policy. The discussion really boiled down to whether there could be a common language, and genuine communication between researchers and policymakers.'
