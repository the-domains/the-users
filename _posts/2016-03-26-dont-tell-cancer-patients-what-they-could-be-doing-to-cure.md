description: "If you're a religious person, for the love of God, don't tell someone with cancer that if they'd just drink juice (or take vitamins, or pray or have a \"positive attitude\") that they could cure themselves. And if you're not a religious person, for the love of reason and decency, don't tell someone with cancer any of these things, either."
