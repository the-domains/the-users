description: 'Premature deaths among autistic people are at "shocking levels" according to a charity report which found that certain groups with the condition die 30 years younger than the general population. The striking figures amount to a "hidden crisis" in public health according to the charity, Autistica, which has called on the NHS to launch an immediate review into the scale and underlying causes of autism deaths in Britain.'
