description: "The government's blanket ban on legal highs that was due to come into effect on 6 April has been postponed for at least a month, the Home Office has said. The Psychoactive Substances Act, which has reached the statute book, has been delayed following claims that its current definition of a psychoactive substance is not enforceable by the police."
