            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>9 things we've learned from a 50-year war on drugs</h1><p>Across the Americas, the model of prohibition has fuelled inequality, bloodshed, and the mass violation of human rights. We need to understand why it has failed.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>In their own words: students share their views on smart drugs</h1><p>Young people, news reports tell us, are turning their backs on drinking and recreational drugs. Cigarette-smoking is on the decline, and so too is teenage pregnancy. It looks like this generation is cleaning up its act. But smart drugs? There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that they are rife at universities in the UK.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9fe987f880109853821d36f761996e457fbeb40e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
