The striking figures amount to a "hidden crisis" in public health according to the charity, Autistica, which has called on the NHS to launch an immediate review into the scale and underlying causes of autism deaths in Britain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d5861cbab1d37f00f97220f5cf205282dd570b58.jpg"></article>]]></description>

The group contends that B.C.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The surreal cityscapes of alternative comic artist Brian Chippendale</h1><p>One of the best gauges of a comic's quality is whether it makes you want to go out and draw comics. Like most of the stuff published by Drawn and Quarterly, Brian Chippendale's Puke Force has exactly that effect. Starting off raw as a serial comic, Puke Force is depraved - full of messy masturbators and chemical burns.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d66c7f90df499a2a3480427be9c40c3fd5b2fdf9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Tell us what you think of plans to ban legal highs | Sarah Marsh</h1><p>Under a law expected to be passed in April, it will be illegal to possess with intent to supply everything from laughing gas to poppers. Critics say the bill is too broad, and could mean restricting any substance affecting a person's "mental or emotional state" except for alcohol and nicotine.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2b641308c33109336651c245f20ad122f4002ac7.jpg"></article>]]></description>
