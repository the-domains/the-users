            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Erowid Psychoactive Vaults : How to Have a Bad Trip, Alienate Your Friends, Get Hospitalized, or Die from Taking Relatively Safe Drugs</h1><p>Don't spend any time learning about the drug(s) you are taking. Dealers know best about the drugs they sell. Your dealer knows best about your dosage. Vendor labeling is completely accurate. Eyeball the dose. Personal test-doses are stupid. Get drunk first. Lick the baggie or bottle after you've measured your dose.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e415246844b1ed231d8b91f9f3f2cdc060b781de.jpg"></article>]]></description>
