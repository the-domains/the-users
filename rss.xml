            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Drug control reformers must remember our commitment to human rights</h1><p>In certain areas of Colombia, a paradox exists. Many drug users have been killed by 'social cleansing' armed groups, funded by drug trafficking and supported by members of the military forces. These victims dramatically reflect two of the critical mistakes of current drug policies: the stigmatisation of drug users, and the strengthening of criminal organisations that control the illegal drug markets and make corrupt alliances with authorities.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/62a0f24787f9886692a5ba188f732a3448d7d7ad.jpg"></article>]]></description>
