The striking figures amount to a "hidden crisis" in public health according to the charity, Autistica, which has called on the NHS to launch an immediate review into the scale and underlying causes of autism deaths in Britain.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d5861cbab1d37f00f97220f5cf205282dd570b58.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The surreal cityscapes of alternative comic artist Brian Chippendale</h1><p>One of the best gauges of a comic's quality is whether it makes you want to go out and draw comics. Like most of the stuff published by Drawn and Quarterly, Brian Chippendale's Puke Force has exactly that effect. Starting off raw as a serial comic, Puke Force is depraved - full of messy masturbators and chemical burns.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d66c7f90df499a2a3480427be9c40c3fd5b2fdf9.jpg"></article>]]></description>
