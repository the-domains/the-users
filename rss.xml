Tell us what you think of plans to ban legal highs | Sarah Marsh</h1><p>Under a law expected to be passed in April, it will be illegal to possess with intent to supply everything from laughing gas to poppers.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>When did the self-help movement lose its ethical seriousness? - Jennifer Ratner-Rosenhagen - Aeon Essays</h1><p>With metronomic regularity, new books about both the strange and the mundane things human beings do with metronomic regularity become bestsellers. The American 'habit' industry produces a huge popular literature examining how habits are formed and how they are broken, how they enable and how they hinder, and how they are a function of heroic self-discipline or a confession of its absence.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a16678a78f2e6b9bcd237386cd75d78bd8f1e538.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Arsenic was their poison - we have tobacco, guns and sugar | David Shariatmadari</h1><p>In the spring and summer of 1871, Brighton was gripped by a series of mysterious poisonings. Chocolate creams from Maynard's, a local sweet shop, had made several people ill. A metallic taste in the mouth was the first sign that something was wrong, followed by a burning sensation in the throat, vomiting and muscle spasms. The symptoms quickly passed, however, and no one thought to take it any further.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/888cc948d18f63f67f96b78c0fa9bf761638f0bd.jpg"></article>]]></description>
