            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A neural pathway that erases memories</h1><p>In order to remember, we must forget. Recent research shows that when your brain retrieves newly encoded information, it suppresses older related information so that it does not interfere with the process of recall. Now a team of European researchers has identified a neural pathway that induces forgetting by actively erasing memories.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/64ed1d1f3b7f133bc1464f85cc8b7bbfbd3ce846.jpg"></article>]]></description>
