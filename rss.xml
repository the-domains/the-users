Nope, we're not in an Amsterdam coffee shop. And no, we're not at that mate-who-loves-to-skin-up's house, either. We're in a potting shed - aptly named - in Devon, South-West England, admiring a decent array of healthy-looking cannabis plants that are in different stages of growth.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8e32567748970f2f25b366994f992f2668f1b70e.png"></article>]]></description>
