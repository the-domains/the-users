            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Arsenic was their poison - we have tobacco, guns and sugar | David Shariatmadari</h1><p>In the spring and summer of 1871, Brighton was gripped by a series of mysterious poisonings. Chocolate creams from Maynard's, a local sweet shop, had made several people ill. A metallic taste in the mouth was the first sign that something was wrong, followed by a burning sensation in the throat, vomiting and muscle spasms. The symptoms quickly passed, however, and no one thought to take it any further.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/888cc948d18f63f67f96b78c0fa9bf761638f0bd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Thinking to some purpose</h1><p>I spent a great day on Wednesday at the annual Alcohol Research UK conference. There was a huge amount of evidence on show, and discussion about the nature of evidence-based policy, how research can produce impact and shape policy. The discussion really boiled down to whether there could be a common language, and genuine communication between researchers and policymakers.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is there something weird about our taste for apocalypse stories? - Frank Bures - Aeon Essays</h1><p>One day in the early 1980s, I was flipping through the TV channels, when I stopped at a news report. The announcer was grey-haired. His tone was urgent. His pronouncement was dire: between the war in the Middle East, famine in Africa, AIDS in the cities, and communists in Afghanistan, it was clear that the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse were upon us.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7934ce1ae99183349437b3503661590744921656.jpg"></article>]]></description>
